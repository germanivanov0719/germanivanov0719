## About my projects

Most of my projects are currently frozen. All web projects would, hopefully, get finished during the 2022 summer. C# projects aren't longer maintained, but some updates might be published later (expect spring‚Äìfall 2022). Projects with "Yandex" in their names would all be available under MIT/Apache2 license and renamed to their official names untill the summer of 2022.
