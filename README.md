# About me
I'm a student in Russia. In my free time I love doing programming. Also, I'm interested in English (currently C1). I used to write code in C#, but now I mainly use Python and HTML/CSS/JS (web development). I know some frameworks, such as WPF (C#), and PyQt, pygame in Python.

# About my projects
Most of my projects are currently frozen. All web projects would, hopefully, get finished during the 2022 summer. C# projects aren't longer maintained, but some updates might be published later (expect springâ€“fall 2022). Projects with "Yandex" in their names would all be available under MIT/Apache3 license and renamed to their official names untill the summer of 2022.
